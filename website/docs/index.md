# Introduction

## About

Welcome to this workshop on <abbr title="Web Application Firewall">WAF</abbr> bypass! In this 2 hour hands-on session, you will learn multiple ways to bypass Web Application Firewall (WAF). No specific knowledge required other that some high-level understanding of common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection and XXE).

I decided to build this workshop to summarize the types of bypasses that can be used in security assesments. Remember that their are no silver bullets. Even with the most complete checklist, it is likely that you will encounters case where you can't find a bypass. Hopefully, we those information you will be more methodical and more efficient the next time you enconter a WAF.
